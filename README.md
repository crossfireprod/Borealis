# Borealis
==================

![Borealis Assembled - Top Profile](/Images/Assembled_TopProfile.jpg)  

WS2812/DMX Light Controller For the [ESPixelStick Firmware](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick) by Shelby Merrick (forkineye).  Hardware supports both DMX (RS-485) and Pixel (WS2811/WS2812) output modes.

**Key Features**
* The [NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) DEVKIT 1.0 was chosen due to pricepoint, availability, form factor, and onboard 3.3v power supply / USB interface (programmer).  
* Either a DC barrel jack or 5.08mm pluggable terminals may be used to supply power.  
* Output power and data is provided via 5.08mm pluggable terminal blocks.  
* PTC is used in lieu of a traditional fuse.  
* Drill hole in PCB allows for use of reverse firing activity LED, if desired.
